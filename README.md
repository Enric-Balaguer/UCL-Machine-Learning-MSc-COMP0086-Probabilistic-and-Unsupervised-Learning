Dear fellow ML students,

In this repo you can find my submission to the 2023/2024 COMP0086 coursework. What's even better, I attach the feedback provided to me so you can improve the parts I did wrong.

I hope this helps. I upload this for people to verify their work and to be a guide for the hard exercises.

Note: If you are going to straight up copy (do not reccommend) I highly reccommend writing everything with your own words and changing the logic of code as much as you can. UCL may keep past year submissions for anti-plagiarism purposes only.
